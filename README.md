## Part A

- Extract a bag-of-words list of nouns, adjectives, and verbs for all targets individually. Then create feature vectors for all training and test data (separately) for all targets.
- Perform classification using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and default settings. `a_2_all.py` is the codes for classify both target and sentiment. `a_2.py` is the codes for only classify target. 
- Improve the results when optimize the settings.
